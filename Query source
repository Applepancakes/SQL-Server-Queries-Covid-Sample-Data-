Can you provide a temporal analysis of COVID-19 cases? Showcasing the daily new cases and the rolling total, and the percentage of cases of the total population

How many new cases were reported on the 2nd of Janurary 2021 in the US? How many is that compared to the total population?

--CTE Rolling New cases of covid using partition
With PopvsNew (Continent, Location, Date, Population, New_Cases, RollingNewCases)
as
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, CONVERT(VARCHAR,dea.date, 23), dea.population, dea.New_Cases
, SUM(CONVERT(int,dea.new_cases)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingNewCases

From P1..CovidDeaths dea
where dea.continent is not null 

)

-- Final SELECT from CTE with additional calculation
Select *, (RollingNewCases/Population) * 100 AS 'Percent of Total Population'

From PopvsNew

WHERE Location LIKE '%states%' AND date = '2021-01-02'

-- Using Temp Table to perform similar calculation on Partition 
In the year of 2020, how did the US compare to the UK in new vaccinations?


DROP TABLE IF exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
CREATE TABLE #PercentPopulationVaccinated
(
Continent nvarchar(255),
Location nvarchar(255),
Date datetime,
Population numeric,
New_vaccinations numeric,
RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)

INSERT INTO #PercentPopulationVaccinated
-- Inserting data into the temp table

SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition BY dea.Location Order BY dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated


FROM P1..CovidDeaths dea

JOIN P1..CovidVaccinations vac
	ON dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date


-- Two SELECT statements for the different countries

SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population) * 100
FROM #PercentPopulationVaccinated
WHERE Location LIKE '%king%' AND date < '2021-01-01'


SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population) * 100
FROM #PercentPopulationVaccinated
WHERE Location LIKE '%states%' AND date < '2021-01-01'

Creating view for visualization purposes

What was the the final impact?

CREATE VIEW OverallImpact AS
-- Creating a view with aggregated data
SELECT
    dea.continent,
    dea.location,
    MAX(dea.date) AS 'Last recorded date',
	dea.population,
    MAX(CONVERT(INT, dea.total_cases)) AS 'Total cases',
    MAX(CONVERT(INT, dea.total_deaths)) AS 'Total deaths',
    MAX(CONVERT(INT, vac.total_tests)) AS 'Total tests',
	MAX(CONVERT(INT, vac.people_fully_vaccinated)) AS 'Fully Vaccinated'
FROM
    P1.dbo.CovidDeaths dea
INNER JOIN
    P1.dbo.CovidVaccinations vac ON dea.location = vac.location
WHERE dea.continent is not null
GROUP BY
    dea.continent, dea.location, dea.population;


-- Selecting data from the view
SELECT * FROM dbo.OverallImpact;
